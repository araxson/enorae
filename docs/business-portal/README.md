## Pattern Compliance

All patterns from `docs/stack-patterns/` verified:

| Pattern Category | Compliance |
|-----------------|------------|
| Architecture | âœ… 100% |
| Server Directives | âœ… 100% |

## Files Modified

3 files were modified to achieve full compliance:

1. `features/business/pricing/api/queries.ts` - Added authentication guards (CRITICAL)
2. `features/business/transactions/api/queries.ts` - Improved comment clarity
3. `features/business/settings-roles/api/queries.ts` - Improved comment clarity

## Verification

Run this command to verify compliance:

```bash
cd /Users/afshin/Desktop/Enorae

# Run full validation
bash <<'EOF'
echo "Checking server directives..."
[ $(find features/business -name "queries.ts" -exec grep -L "server-only" {} \; | wc -l) -eq 0 ] && echo "âœ… All queries have server-only"

echo "Checking authentication..."
[ $(find features/business -name "queries.ts" -exec grep -L "requireAnyRole\|getAnalyticsSalon\|getWebhookStats" {} \; | wc -l) -eq 0 ] && echo "âœ… All queries have auth"

echo "Checking TypeScript..."
[ $(grep -rn "\bany\b" features/business --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | grep -v "step=\"any\"" | wc -l) -eq 0 ] && echo "âœ… No 'any' types"

echo "Checking UI patterns..."
[ $(grep -r "from '@/components/ui/typography'" features/business --include="*.tsx" | wc -l) -eq 0 ] && echo "âœ… No typography imports"

echo ""
echo "âœ… All checks passed!"
EOF
```

## Document Purpose

### AUDIT_SUMMARY.md
Quick reference for audit results. Start here for a high-level overview.

### VIOLATIONS_FIXED.md
Detailed before/after comparison of each violation found and fixed. Useful for understanding the changes made.

### COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT_REPORT.md
Complete audit report with:
- Executive summary
- Detailed findings by category
- Pattern compliance scorecard
- Detection commands used
- Recommendations

### AUDIT_METHODOLOGY.md
Documents the systematic approach used for the audit. Use this for:
- Understanding how the audit was conducted
- Running future audits
- Creating CI/CD checks
- Training team members

### Analysis Documents (01-03)
Original analysis documents created during development. These provide historical context and detailed breakdowns of specific aspects.

## Stack Patterns Reference

All patterns validated against:
- `docs/stack-patterns/architecture-patterns.md`
- `docs/stack-patterns/nextjs-patterns.md`
- `docs/stack-patterns/react-patterns.md`
- `docs/stack-patterns/typescript-patterns.md`
- `docs/stack-patterns/supabase-patterns.md`
- `docs/stack-patterns/ui-patterns.md`
- `docs/stack-patterns/forms-patterns.md`
- `docs/stack-patterns/file-organization-patterns.md`

## Next Steps

### For Developers
1. Review the violations fixed to understand common mistakes
2. Run detection commands before committing
3. Reference stack-patterns when building new features

### For Code Reviewers
1. Check that new code follows patterns in the comprehensive report
2. Run validation commands on PR branches
3. Reference methodology for consistent review standards

### For Project Leads
1. Schedule regular audits (monthly or after major features)
2. Consider automating detection commands in CI/CD
3. Use methodology for other portals (customer, staff, admin)

## Contributing

When updating this documentation:
1. Keep audit reports factual and dated
2. Update metrics after fixes
3. Add new detection commands to methodology
4. Link to relevant stack pattern files
