# Business Portal - Audit Methodology

This document describes the systematic approach used to audit the Business Portal for stack pattern compliance.

## Audit Phases

### Phase 1: Codebase Scanning (Detection)

Comprehensive scans using grep, find, and custom scripts to detect:
- Missing server directives
- Missing authentication guards
- TypeScript violations
- UI pattern violations
- Database pattern violations
- Architecture violations

**Tools Used:**
- `find` - Locate files by name and type
- `grep` - Search file contents for patterns
- `wc` - Count lines and violations
- Custom bash scripts - Multi-criteria validation

### Phase 2: Violation Classification

Organize findings into severity categories:

#### Critical Violations
- Missing authentication guards
- Schema table reads in queries
- Missing server directives on public functions
- 'any' type usage in production code

#### High Violations
- Missing revalidatePath after mutations
- Oversized page files (business logic in pages)
- Client components doing data fetching

#### Medium Violations
- Missing TypeScript types
- Inconsistent error handling
- Performance anti-patterns

#### Low Violations
- Comment clarity
- Code style inconsistencies
- Missing JSDoc comments

### Phase 3: Deep Investigation

For each detected violation:
1. Read the full file context
2. Understand the intent
3. Check for delegation patterns
4. Verify against stack patterns
5. Determine if it's a true violation or false positive

### Phase 4: Systematic Remediation

Fix violations in dependency order:
1. Architecture violations (affects everything else)
2. Database violations (security critical)
3. Server directive violations (security critical)
4. TypeScript violations (type safety)
5. UI violations (consistency)
6. Code quality violations (maintainability)

### Phase 5: Verification

After fixes:
1. Re-run detection commands
2. Verify no new violations introduced
3. Check related code patterns
4. Validate type checking passes
5. Confirm auth guards in place

### Phase 6: Documentation

Generate reports:
- Executive summary
- Detailed findings
- Before/after code samples
- Pattern compliance scorecard
- Recommendations

## Detection Commands

### Server Directives

```bash
# Missing 'server-only' in queries.ts
for file in $(find features/business -name "queries.ts"); do
  if ! grep -q "server-only" "$file"; then
    echo "$file"
  fi
done

# Missing 'use server' in mutations.ts
for file in $(find features/business -name "mutations.ts"); do
  lines=$(wc -l < "$file" | xargs)
  if [ "$lines" -gt 5 ]; then
    if ! grep -q "'use server'" "$file"; then
      echo "$file"
    fi
  fi
done
```

### Authentication

```bash
# Queries without auth verification
for file in $(find features/business -name "queries.ts"); do
  if grep -q "export async function" "$file"; then
    if ! grep -q "requireAnyRole\|getUser\|verifySession" "$file"; then
      echo "$file"
    fi
  fi
done
```

### TypeScript

```bash
# Find 'any' type usage
grep -rn "\bany\b" features/business --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" \
  | grep -v "node_modules" \
  | grep -v "// any" \
  | grep -v "step=\"any\""

# Find @ts-ignore
grep -rn "@ts-ignore" features/business --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"

# Find @ts-expect-error
grep -rn "@ts-expect-error" features/business --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"
```

### UI Patterns

```bash
# Typography imports
grep -r "from '@/components/ui/typography'" features/business --include="*.tsx"

# Slot styling violations
grep -rn "CardTitle.*className=\|CardDescription.*className=\|AlertTitle.*className=" \
  features/business --include="*.tsx"

# Arbitrary colors
grep -rn "#[0-9a-fA-F]\{3,6\}" features/business --include="*.tsx"
```

### Database Patterns

```bash
# Schema table reads in queries
grep -rn "\.from\(" features/business/*/api/queries.ts \
  | grep -v "_view" \
  | grep -v "schema("

# Missing revalidatePath in mutations
for file in $(find features/business -name "mutations.ts"); do
  lines=$(wc -l < "$file" | xargs)
  if [ "$lines" -gt 20 ]; then
    if ! grep -q "revalidatePath" "$file"; then
      echo "$file"
    fi
  fi
done
```

### Page Architecture

```bash
# Oversized pages
find app/\(business\) -name "page.tsx" -exec sh -c '
  lines=$(wc -l < "$1" | xargs)
  if [ "$lines" -gt 15 ]; then
    echo "$1: $lines lines"
  fi
' _ {} \;
```

### Feature Organization

```bash
# Features missing index.tsx
for dir in features/business/*/; do
  if [ ! -f "$dir/index.tsx" ]; then
    echo "$dir"
  fi
done

# Features missing api directory
for dir in features/business/*/; do
  if [ ! -d "$dir/api" ]; then
    echo "$dir"
  fi
done
```

## Validation Strategy

### False Positive Filtering

Some patterns delegate to other functions. Always check:

1. **Delegated Auth:** Query file imports and calls functions that have auth
2. **Delegated Revalidation:** Mutation delegates to helpers with revalidatePath
3. **Intentional Stubs:** Empty mutations.ts files for features not implemented yet

### Context-Aware Analysis

Don't just pattern match - understand the code:

```typescript
// This LOOKS like missing auth but delegates to getAnalyticsSalon
export async function getCustomerAnalytics() {
  const { id } = await getAnalyticsSalon() // âœ… Has auth
  // ...
}
```

### Dependency Analysis

Fix in order:
1. Architecture first (affects structure)
2. Security second (auth, database)
3. Types third (safety)
4. UI fourth (consistency)
5. Quality last (polish)

## Quality Assurance

### Before Fixes
- Document current state
- Screenshot/save violations
- Note false positives

### During Fixes
- Fix one category at a time
- Test each fix
- Don't introduce new violations

### After Fixes
- Re-run all detection commands
- Compare before/after
- Verify 100% compliance

---

## Reporting Standards

### Executive Summary
- Total violations by category
- Severity breakdown
- Overall compliance score

### Detailed Findings
- File-by-file violations
- Before/after code samples
- Pattern references
- Fix explanations

### Verification Evidence
- Detection command output
- Test results
- Compliance scorecard

## Automation Opportunities

### Pre-Commit Hooks
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Run detection commands
violations=0

# Check for missing server-only
if find features/business -name "queries.ts" -exec grep -L "server-only" {} \; | grep -q .; then
  echo "Error: Missing 'server-only' in queries.ts"
  ((violations++))
fi

# Exit if violations found
if [ $violations -gt 0 ]; then
  exit 1
fi
```

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/patterns-check.yml

## Lessons from This Audit

### What Worked Well
1. Systematic phase-by-phase approach
2. Automated detection scripts
3. Deep investigation of apparent violations
4. Context-aware analysis (not just pattern matching)
5. Comprehensive documentation

### Challenges Encountered
1. False positives from delegation patterns
2. Comment-only "any" usage flagged
3. Need to verify actual mutation behavior vs. stub files

### Improvements for Next Time
1. Add delegation pattern detection
2. Improve comment parsing
3. Create reusable audit scripts
4. Build CI/CD integration

## Conclusion

This audit methodology provides a systematic, repeatable process for ensuring stack pattern compliance. The Business Portal audit demonstrated its effectiveness, finding and fixing all violations while maintaining high confidence in the results.

**Next Audit Target:** Consider applying this methodology to other portals (customer, staff, admin, marketing).
