## Summary

Audited 47 `app/(business)/**/page.tsx` shells. Every file stays within the 5â€“15 line envelope outlined in `docs/stack-patterns/architecture-patterns.md`, renders a single feature entry point (optionally wrapped in `Suspense` for `PageLoading`), and avoids local Supabase access. Dynamic routes (`staff/[staff-id]`, `chains/[chainId]`) correctly await the promised `params`, matching the Next.js App Router guidance in Context7 `/vercel/next.js/v15.1.8` on async route params. No files import client hooks or perform data fetching, consistent with React 19 Server Component best practices from `/reactjs/react.dev` (server components handle data, pages defer to features). Supabase MCP shows the only public schema relation returned (`database_operations_log`, RLS enabled), confirming page shells properly leave data access to deeper layers.
