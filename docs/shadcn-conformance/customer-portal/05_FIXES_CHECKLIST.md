# Fixes Checklist

## ✅ Task: Normalize VIP Status Card Structure
- [x] Read shadcn Card documentation and confirm header/footer slot expectations.
- [x] Update `vip-status-card.tsx` to keep `CardTitle`/`CardDescription` as direct slot content.
- [x] Move icon styling into inline spans so the slots remain unstyled.
- [x] Remove custom `CardFooter` classNames; wrap footer text in semantic elements instead.
- [x] Swap dashboard usage to render `<VIPStatusCard vipStatus={vipStatus} />`.
- [x] Verify VIP banner renders identically across viewport sizes.

## ✅ Task: Restore Customer Metrics Canonical Slots
- [x] Replace free-floating `CardDescription` with plain text or a Card wrapper.
- [x] Remove classNames from `CardHeader`; apply layout inside child containers.
- [x] Re-run component to confirm spacing matches shadcn reference.
- [x] Capture before/after screenshots for regression history.

## ✅ Task: Remove Slot Padding Overrides
- [x] Update `transaction-card.tsx` to wrap content in padded divs instead of styling slots.
- [x] Adjust `appointment-detail.tsx` services card to keep `CardContent` padding intact.
- [x] Inspect other transaction/appointment cards for similar overrides.
- [x] Run `npm run lint` to ensure no unused classNames remain.

## ✅ Task: Rebuild SalonResultsGrid Cards
- [x] Refactor header to present `CardTitle` and `CardDescription` directly.
- [x] Move badges and icons into `CardContent` or inline spans within the title.
- [x] Replace `CardContent` typography classes with inner paragraph elements.
- [x] Test featured + standard cards to confirm layout parity.

## ✅ Task: Update ReviewsList Body Copy
- [x] Convert review comment/date fields to semantic paragraphs.
- [x] Keep `CardDescription` confined to the header context.
- [x] Verify typography matches other review components.
- [x] Add a quick regression test in Storybook/Playground if available, then mark complete.

> Note: `npm run lint` still surfaces pre-existing issues in admin/staff modules; customer portal updates lint cleanly.
