# Customer Portal - Pages Analysis

## Summary

Reviewed all Customer portal page shells under `app/(customer)/customer/**/page.tsx`. Every file stays within the 5–15 line guideline, defers rendering to feature components, and keeps routing metadata colocated. No page performs data fetching directly, and dynamic routes correctly await the `params` promise surface. The only deviation observed is a handful of page exports marked `async` without performing any asynchronous work, which produces unnecessary promise wrappers.

## Issues

### Low Priority

#### Issue #1: Async Page Shells Without Awaited Work
**Severity**: Low  
**File**: `app/(customer)/customer/appointments/page.tsx:8`, `app/(customer)/customer/messages/page.tsx:8`, `app/(customer)/customer/transactions/page.tsx:8`, `app/(customer)/customer/chains/page.tsx:8`, `app/(customer)/customer/reviews/page.tsx:5`  
**Rule Violation**: CLAUDE Rule 3 (Pages are thin shells) & TypeScript 5.6 best practice — avoid `async` wrappers without awaits to prevent implicit Promise returns.

**Current Code** (`app/(customer)/customer/transactions/page.tsx:8-9`):
```typescript
export default async function TransactionsPage() {
  return <CustomerTransactionsPage />
}
```

**Problem**: Marking these shell components as `async` when no asynchronous work occurs forces Next.js to treat the render as a Promise unnecessarily. This diverges from the lightweight page-shell pattern in `docs/stack-patterns/architecture-patterns.md` and can complicate type signatures by returning `Promise<JSX.Element>` when a synchronous `JSX.Element` is sufficient.

**Required Fix**:
```typescript
export default function TransactionsPage() {
  return <CustomerTransactionsPage />
}
```

**Steps to Fix**:
1. Remove the `async` keyword from each affected page export.
2. Ensure no `await` usage remains (none today).
3. Run `npm run typecheck` to confirm signatures remain valid.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Page shells in the listed files export synchronous functions.
- [ ] `npm run typecheck` passes without new warnings.

**Dependencies**: None
