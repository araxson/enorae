## Summary

- Reviewed all `app/(customer)/**/page.tsx` entries; each stays within the 5–15 line shell guidance from `docs/stack-patterns/nextjs-patterns.md`, with business logic delegated to feature modules.
- Confirmed no direct data fetching or Supabase access occurs at the page level, aligning with Context7 Next.js App Router best practices that reserve data work for server components and feature boundaries.
- Dynamic routes correctly consume `params` as promises (per Next.js 15 guidance) before hydrating feature components—for example, `app/(customer)/customer/appointments/[id]/page.tsx` unwraps the identifier before handing it to `AppointmentDetail`.
- Pages exporting metadata or dynamic hints (`dynamic`, `generateMetadata`) do so declaratively and forward Context7-recommended metadata factories from their features.
- Suspense fallbacks are provided where streaming is expected (`CustomerPortalPage`, `CustomerAppointmentsPage`, etc.), matching the streaming-first recommendations gathered earlier.
