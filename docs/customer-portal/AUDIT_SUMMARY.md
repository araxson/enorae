## What Was Verified (Already Compliant)

### ✅ Architecture Patterns
- All 22 pages are 5-15 lines (perfect shell pattern)
- All 17 features follow canonical folder structure
- No business logic in page files

### ✅ Server Directives
- All 17 `queries.ts` files have `import 'server-only'`
- All 17 `mutations.ts` files have `'use server'`

### ✅ Database & Security
- All queries include `requireAuth()` or `verifySession()`
- All queries filter by authenticated user ID
- All queries use public views from `Database['public']['Views']`
- All mutations include `revalidatePath()` calls

### ✅ TypeScript Strict Mode
- Zero `any` types found
- Zero `@ts-ignore` comments found
- All functions properly typed

### ✅ Forms & Validation
- Zod schemas in: profile, reviews, booking, referrals
- React Hook Form integration
- Server action validation
