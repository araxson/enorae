## Issues Found

### 🔴 Critical Issues (Breaks User Flow)

#### 1. Admin Settings Page Missing

---

### 🟡 High Priority Issues (Bad UX)

#### 3. Missing 404 Pages
- **Issue**: No custom 404 pages for each portal
- **Impact**: Generic error page, poor UX
- **Fix**: Create portal-specific `not-found.tsx` files

#### 4. Inconsistent Dashboard Routes
- **Admin**: `/admin` (root)
- **Business**: `/business/dashboard` (nested)
- **Staff**: `/staff` (root)
- **Customer**: `/customer` (root)
- **Impact**: Confusing mental model
- **Fix**: Standardize all to root or all to /dashboard

---

### 🟢 Medium Priority Issues (Minor Annoyances)

#### 5. Missing Loading States
- **Issue**: Some pages lack loading.tsx
- **Impact**: No loading feedback
- **Fix**: Add loading.tsx to all route segments

## Redirect Issues

### Current Redirect Behavior

1. **After Login**:
   - super_admin → `/admin` ✅
   - tenant_owner → `/business/dashboard` ✅
   - staff → `/staff` ✅
   - customer → `/customer/salons` ⚠️ (should be `/customer`?)

2. **After Signup**:
   - Redirects to OTP verification ✅
   - After OTP → `/customer/salons` ⚠️ (should be `/customer`?)

3. **Unauthenticated Access**:
   - Protected routes → `/login` ✅

**Recommendation**: Standardize post-login/signup redirects

---

## Navigation Issues

### Sidebar Issues

1. **Business Settings**:
   - Sidebar shows only "Settings" → `/business/settings/salon`
   - But has multiple settings pages:
     - /business/settings/salon
     - /business/settings/contact
     - /business/settings/description
     - /business/settings/media
     - /business/settings/webhooks
   - **Fix**: Add nested menu or tabs

2. **Admin Hidden Routes**:
   - revenue, security, salons, roles, moderation exist but not in sidebar
   - **Fix**: Document or add to sidebar

---

## Error Handling Issues

### Missing Error Pages

1. **No portal-specific 404 pages**:
   - Need: `/admin/not-found.tsx`
   - Need: `/business/not-found.tsx`
   - Need: `/staff/not-found.tsx`
   - Need: `/customer/not-found.tsx`

2. **No portal-specific error pages**:
   - Currently using generic error.tsx
   - Should have portal-branded error pages

---

## Loading State Issues

### Missing Loading Pages

Many routes lack `loading.tsx`:
- /admin/* (most routes)
- /business/* (most routes)
- /staff/* (most routes)
- /customer/* (most routes)

**Impact**: No loading feedback during navigation

---

## Breadcrumb Issues

- **Issue**: Deep nested routes have no breadcrumbs
- **Example**: `/business/inventory/categories` - user can't easily navigate back
- **Fix**: Implement breadcrumb component in layout

---

## Link Issues in Components

Need to audit:
1. Dashboard cards - check all "View more" links
2. Sidebar active state highlighting
3. Button links vs navigation links
4. External links (should open in new tab)

---
