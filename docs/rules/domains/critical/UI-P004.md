# üî¥ UI-P004: Remove `@/components/ui/typography` usage; rely on component slots

**Pattern:** Eliminate ALL custom Typography components. Remove every import from `@/components/ui/typography` (H1, H2, H3, P, Lead, Muted, Small, Large, etc.). Maximize shadcn/ui primitive usage by exploring 50+ components and blocks via the shadcn MCP. Use component slots (CardTitle, CardDescription, AlertDescription, DialogTitle, AccordionTrigger, etc.) for text, **with their default sizing and styling unchanged**. Apply only layout/spacing classes when needed for arrangement (gap, flex, padding). Do NOT customize the sizing, font weight, or color of slot components‚Äîthey already have design-system-compliant sizing. Restructure existing markup to match shadcn composition patterns. Only fall back to semantic HTML with design tokens when absolutely no shadcn primitive or block matches.

**Why:** Typography primitives duplicate styling, create inconsistent spacing, and drift from shadcn patterns. Component slots already encode accessible typography, sizing, and theming‚Äîcustomizing their appearance breaks the design system and causes visual inconsistency. The shadcn library provides 50+ components and numerous blocks that cover virtually all UI patterns, eliminating the need for custom typography wrappers or sizing tweaks.

**Detection:**
```bash
rg "from '@/components/ui/typography'" --glob '!docs/**' --glob '!components/ui/**'
```
