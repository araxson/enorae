# üî¥ UI-P002: shadcn/ui compositions must include required subcomponents

**Pattern:** Use shadcn/ui components with all required subcomponents as specified in the registry. Each component slot must render with its default sizing and styling unchanged. Do NOT customize font size, weight, or color on component slots. Apply only layout/spacing classes (flex, grid, gap, padding, margin) for arrangement.

**Why:** shadcn/ui subcomponents encode the correct semantic structure, accessibility attributes, and design-system sizing. Skipping subcomponents breaks accessibility and layout. Customizing slot styling breaks the visual design system and creates inconsistency. Component slots already have the correct sizing built in.

**Detection:** Manual review required.
