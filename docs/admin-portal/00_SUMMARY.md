# Admin Portal – Audit Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-26  
**Portal**: Admin  
**Scope**: Pages, Queries, Mutations, Components, Types, Validation, Security  
**Files Analyzed**: 424  
**Total Issues**: 15 (Critical: 2, High: 7, Medium: 6, Low: 0)  
**Estimated Remediation Effort**: ~24 hours

---

## Issue Overview
- **Critical (2)** – Query layer reads raw schema tables; security mutations write to tables that don’t exist, leaving protections inoperative.
- **High (7)** – SECURITY DEFINER views bypass RLS; placeholder schemas provide no validation; card slots styled with typography; unsafe type casts; security workflows broken; Supabase advisors flag additional hardening gaps.
- **Medium (6)** – Suspense fallbacks missing loading UI; JSON parsing bypasses validation; button primitives skipped; multiple type/validation concerns.

### Issues by Layer
| Layer | Critical | High | Medium | Notes |
|-------|----------|------|--------|-------|
| Pages | 0 | 0 | 1 | Suspense fallbacks render `null` on critical routes. |
| Queries | 1 | 1 | 0 | Raw schema reads; `AdminSalon` type mismatch. |
| Mutations | 1 | 1 | 1 | Security monitoring writes fail; user status ignores write errors; anonymize action is a no-op. |
| Components | 0 | 1 | 1 | Typography classes on card slots; raw `<button>` usage. |
| Types | 0 | 1 | 1 | `getAllUsers` double-cast; Supabase queries missing `.returns<…>()`. |
| Validation | 0 | 1 | 1 | Eighteen features ship `z.object({})`; JSON parsing outside Zod. |
| Security | 0 | 2 | 1 | SECURITY DEFINER views; nonexistent security tables; leaked password protection disabled. |

## High-Risk Findings
1. **SECURITY DEFINER Admin Views** – Seven public views execute with elevated privileges (`admin_salons_overview_view`, `admin_appointments_overview_view`, etc.), completely bypassing RLS (Supabase advisor lint `security_definer_view`).  
2. **Security Monitoring Mutations Point to Missing Tables** – Actions like `acknowledgeSecurityAlert` and `quarantineSession` write to `public.security_access_logs`, `session_security_events`, etc., none of which exist. Security workflows currently fail silently.  
3. **Empty Feature Schemas** – 18 `schema.ts` files export `z.object({})`, leaving forms and filters without validation coverage.  
4. **Supabase Auth Hardening** – Leaked password protection is off (advisor `auth_leaked_password_protection`). Enable the setting to block compromised passwords.

## Recommended Remediation Order
1. **Secure the Database Layer**
   - Recreate or replace SECURITY DEFINER views with RLS-compliant equivalents.
   - Align security-monitoring mutations with actual `security.*` tables (or create the missing tables via migrations).
2. **Restore Validation Guarantees**
   - Replace all `z.object({})` placeholders with real schemas and reuse them in forms/actions.
   - Fix `logSecurityIncident` to validate JSON inside Zod.
3. **Enhance API/Type Safety**
   - Remove `as unknown as AdminUser[]` fallback; map or drop the data.
   - Add `.returns<…>()` to Supabase queries to eliminate structural casts.
4. **UI Consistency**
   - Move typography classes off `CardContent` slots; swap bespoke `<button>` elements for `Button`.
   - Add visible Suspense fallbacks to the listed monitoring pages.
5. **Enable Supabase Hardening**
   - Turn on leaked password protection in Supabase Auth and re-run advisors to confirm.

---

## Quick Stats
- **Views flagged by Supabase**: 7 (`SECURITY DEFINER`)
- **Placeholder schemas**: 18 features still exporting `z.object({})`
- **Security workflows broken**: 2 modules (access monitoring, session security)
- **Total estimated fix time**: ~24 hours (excludes database migration review & approvals)

---

## Suggested Next Steps
1. Schedule a database migration sprint to rework SECURITY DEFINER views and align security tables.
2. Backfill real Zod schemas for each feature and wire them into existing forms/mutations.
3. Prioritise the security mutation fixes and Supabase Auth configuration so monitoring actions deliver real protection.
4. Track progress by re-running Supabase advisors and the layer-specific audits after remediation.
