## üöÄ How to Use

### Method 1: Using Claude Code Agent Generator

1. Open the specific prompt file (e.g., `01-schema-structure-analyzer.md`)
2. Copy the entire content
3. Send to Claude Code with:
   ```
   Generate an agent using this prompt: [paste prompt]
   ```
4. Claude Code will create a specialized agent that runs autonomously
5. Wait for the agent to complete and generate the report

### Method 2: Direct Execution

Simply send to Claude Code:
```
Use the [analyzer name] prompt from docs/database-analysis-prompts/ to analyze my database
```

Example:
```
Use the security and RLS analyzer prompt to analyze my database
```

### Method 3: Master Coordinator (Recommended)

For comprehensive analysis:
```
Use the master coordinator prompt to run a complete database analysis
```

This runs all analyzers and generates a master summary.

## üìä Understanding Reports

### Report Sections

Each report includes:

1. **Executive Summary** - Key metrics and critical issues
2. **Detailed Analysis** - Comprehensive findings by category
3. **Critical Issues** - High/Medium/Low priority problems
4. **Recommendations** - Actionable steps prioritized by impact
5. **Appendices** - Complete data inventories and references

### Issue Priorities

- üî¥ **Critical** - Fix immediately (security, data loss risk)
- üü† **High Priority** - Fix this week (performance, patterns)
- üü° **Medium Priority** - Fix this month (optimization, tech debt)
- üü¢ **Low Priority** - Nice to have (minor improvements)

### Health Scores

Reports include health scores (0-100):
- **90-100:** Excellent - minimal issues
- **75-89:** Good - minor improvements needed
- **60-74:** Fair - several issues to address
- **40-59:** Poor - significant problems
- **0-39:** Critical - urgent intervention required

## üéì Best Practices

### Before Running Analysis

1. ‚úÖ Ensure database is in stable state
2. ‚úÖ Complete any pending migrations
3. ‚úÖ Back up database (if making changes after)
4. ‚úÖ Note any known issues for comparison
5. ‚úÖ Schedule during low-traffic period (for performance queries)

### After Analysis

1. ‚úÖ Review master executive summary first
2. ‚úÖ Triage critical issues immediately
3. ‚úÖ Create tasks for high-priority items
4. ‚úÖ Share reports with relevant team members
5. ‚úÖ Track improvements over time
6. ‚úÖ Schedule next analysis

### Interpreting Results

- **Don't panic** - Most databases have issues to address
- **Prioritize** - Focus on critical and high-priority items first
- **Incremental** - Fix issues over time, not all at once
- **Monitor** - Track improvements with regular analysis
- **Context matters** - Consider your specific requirements

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Agent Fails to Complete

**Possible causes:**
- Database timeout on large queries
- Insufficient permissions
- Network connectivity issues

**Solutions:**
- Run smaller analyzers individually
- Check Supabase MCP connection
- Increase query timeouts
- Run during low-traffic period

### Reports Are Incomplete

**Possible causes:**
- Large database size (>10GB)
- Complex view definitions
- Slow queries timing out

**Solutions:**
- Run analyzers separately instead of coordinator
- Exclude specific schemas if needed
- Review individual SQL queries and optimize

### Permission Errors

**Possible causes:**
- Insufficient database role
- Missing RLS policies
- Service role not configured

**Solutions:**
- Use service role for analysis
- Check Supabase project permissions
- Review MCP configuration

## üìù Customization

### Modifying Prompts

You can customize prompts by:

1. **Changing SQL queries** - Add/remove analysis queries
2. **Adjusting thresholds** - Change what's considered critical
3. **Adding checks** - Include project-specific validations
4. **Filtering scope** - Limit to specific schemas or tables

### Creating Custom Analyzers

To create your own analyzer:

1. Copy an existing prompt as template
2. Define your analysis objectives
3. Write SQL queries for your checks
4. Design report structure
5. Test with small datasets first

## ü§ù Contributing

Found an issue or have suggestions?

1. Document the problem/enhancement
2. Provide example use case
3. Submit feedback to project maintainers
