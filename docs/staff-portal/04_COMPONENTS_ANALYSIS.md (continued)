**Rule Violation**: CLAUDE.md UI Rule 1 (Compose with shadcn primitives; avoid ad-hoc typography).

**Current Code**:
```tsx
{activeTab === 'team' && (
  <div className="space-y-4">
    <h3 className="scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Team Time Off Calendar</h3>
    …
  </div>
)}
```

**Problem**:
The section heading uses raw Tailwind typography classes instead of the shared heading component or card slots. This creates inconsistent text styles across tabs and deviates from the required shadcn-based composition.

**Required Fix**:
```tsx
{activeTab === 'team' && (
  <Card>
    <CardHeader>
      <CardTitle>Team Time Off Calendar</CardTitle>
      <CardDescription>Upcoming requests from your teammates</CardDescription>
    </CardHeader>
    <CardContent>{/* existing calendar content */}</CardContent>
  </Card>
)}
```
If the list shouldn’t be wrapped in a card, use the shared `SectionHeading` component (or create one per UI patterns) that encapsulates the correct typography.

**Steps to Fix**:
1. Wrap the team calendar block in a `Card` (or shared section component).  
2. Replace `<h3>` + classes with `CardTitle/CardDescription`.  
3. Adjust surrounding layout to prevent nested cards producing double padding.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Team view uses design-system headings without ad-hoc typography classes.  
- [ ] Layout spacing remains consistent across tabs.  
- [ ] No regression in calendar rendering.

**Dependencies**: None

- Files Affected: 4  
- Estimated Fix Time: 6 hours  
- Breaking Changes: 0 (visual polish only, but noticeable to users)

## Next Steps

1. Refactor summary grid and profile cards to honour shadcn slot semantics.  
2. Replace raw headings with design-system primitives in time-off and other sections.  
3. Once UI consistency is restored, proceed to type-safety analysis.
