## Summary

- Reviewed representative server and client components under `features/staff/**/components/`; all UI building blocks rely on shadcn/ui primitives (`Card`, `Button`, `Badge`, etc.) in line with `docs/stack-patterns/ui-patterns.md`.
- Slot elements (`CardTitle`, `CardDescription`, `AlertTitle`, etc.) are rendered without custom `className` overrides, matching the “use slots as-is” requirement.
- Layout adjustments stay within container elements (e.g., wrapping `CardHeader` contents) and use only spacing utilities, consistent with shadcn guidance.
- No typography imports or bespoke primitives were detected (`rg "@/components/ui/typography"` returned none).
- Client components handling actions (`BlockedTimesList`, `MessageThreadList`) delegate mutations to server actions and keep UI state local, following React 19 recommendations for mixing Server and Client components.
