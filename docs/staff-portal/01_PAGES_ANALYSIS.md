## Summary

Validated all `app/(staff)/**/page.tsx` files as lightweight shells per CLAUDE.md Rule 3. Every page stays between 5–12 lines (e.g. `app/(staff)/staff/page.tsx:1-10`), renders a single feature component, and avoids inline data fetching, aligning with Next.js Server Component guidance to keep data access in server features and actions (Context7: Next.js App Router, “Server Components for Data Fetching”). Dynamic route handling for message threads correctly awaits the promised `params` object introduced in Next.js 15, keeping routing compliant with the App Router contract (Context7: “Implementing Streaming with React Suspense” & “Server Components for Data Fetching”). Suspense fallbacks match platform patterns (`StaffPortalPage` uses `<PageLoading />`), and metadata exports remain declarative, keeping page modules side-effect free and ready for React 19 streaming semantics.
