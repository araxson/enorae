# Staff Portal - Pages Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Portal**: Staff
**Layer**: Pages
**Files Analyzed**: 18
**Issues Found**: 0 (Critical: 0, High: 0, Medium: 0, Low: 0)

---

## Summary

- Reviewed every `app/(staff)/staff/**/page.tsx` entry point; all pages stay within the 5â€“12 line guideline from `docs/stack-patterns/nextjs-patterns.md`.
- Each page delegates rendering to its feature module without in-place data fetching, aligning with Next.js App Router composition best practices from `/vercel/next.js/v15.1.8`.
- Metadata declarations either reuse the shared generator (`generateMetadata`) or export static objects, keeping configuration colocated with the entry file.
- Suspense usage on `app/(staff)/staff/page.tsx` follows the React 19 server component guidance from `/reactjs/react.dev`.
- No deviations found that would impact routing, layout, or shell responsibilities at this layer.
