   - preferences.ts
   - send.ts
   - templates.ts
   - test.ts
   - utilities.ts
   - workflows.ts
   - Fix: Add `'use server'` at line 1 of each file

9-14. **services/api/mutations/** (6 files):
   - create-service.mutation.ts

   // ✅ CORRECT
   import { formatters } from './components'
   ```

2. **reviews/index.tsx**
   ```typescript
   // ❌ WRONG
   import { ReviewsList } from './components/reviews-list'
   import { ReviewsStats } from './components/reviews-stats'

   // ✅ CORRECT
   import { ReviewsList, ReviewsStats } from './components'
   ```

3-23. Similar violations in:
   - service-categories/index.tsx
   - service-performance-analytics/index.tsx
   - service-pricing/index.tsx
   - services/index.tsx

   - staff-services/index.tsx
   - time-off/index.tsx
   - transactions/index.tsx
   - webhooks/index.tsx
   - webhooks-monitoring/index.tsx

**Fix Steps:**
1. Ensure component is exported from `components/index.ts`
2. Update feature index to import from `./components`
3. Verify imports resolve correctly

---

## LOW PRIORITY VIOLATIONS (7 total)

### 11. File Naming - Dot Notation (7 violations)

Files using dot notation instead of kebab-case (except test/spec files).

1. **analytics/api/analytics.types.ts**
   - Rename to: `api/types.ts`

2. **coupons/components/coupon-form.types.ts**
   - Rename to: `types.ts` or move to feature level

3-7. **services/api/mutations/** (5 files):
   - create-service.mutation.ts → create-service.ts
   - create-service.schemas.ts → schemas.ts
   - delete-service.mutation.ts → delete-service.ts
   - update-service.mutation.ts → update-service.ts
   - permanently-delete-service.mutation.ts → permanently-delete-service.ts

**Note:** Directory name already provides context (mutations/), so suffix is redundant.

---

## COMPLIANT PATTERNS ✅

The business portal demonstrates excellent compliance in several areas:

### 1. Authentication Pattern ✅
- **Zero** instances of deprecated `getSession()`
- All auth uses `getUser()` or `requireAnyRole()`
- Consistent pattern across 657 files

### 2. Directory Structure ✅
- All features follow Pattern 1 (Portal Features)
- Proper `api/queries/` and `api/mutations/` organization
- No prohibited directories (`utils/`, `helpers/`, `lib/`)

### 3. Server Components ✅
- 639 of 657 files have correct server directives
- Proper use of `'use server'` in mutations
- Consistent `import 'server-only'` in queries

### 4. Type Safety ✅
- No `any` types detected
- Proper Zod schemas for validation
- Database types imported from lib/types/database.types.ts

### 5. Kebab-case Naming ✅
- 650 of 657 files use correct naming
- Component names match file names
- Consistent PascalCase exports

### 6. Component Organization ✅
- All features use `components/` directory
- Most have proper `components/index.ts`
- Logical component grouping

### 7. Re-export Pattern ✅
- Most features use `index.tsx` for exports
- API functions properly re-exported
- Clean public interfaces

  rules: {
    'max-lines': ['error', {
      max: 200,
      skipBlankLines: true,
      skipComments: true
    }],
    'no-restricted-imports': ['error', {
      patterns: [
        // Prevent bypassing component index
        './components/*',
        '!./components'
      ]
    }]
  },
  overrides: [
    {
      files: ['**/api/queries/*.ts', '**/api/mutations/*.ts'],
      rules: {
        'max-lines': ['error', { max: 300 }]
      }
    },
    {
      files: ['**/index.tsx', '**/index.ts'],
      rules: {
        'max-lines': ['error', { max: 50 }]

## DEVELOPER GUIDELINES

### When Creating New Features

1. **Use the Pattern:**
   ```
   features/business/{feature}/
   ├── api/
   │   ├── queries/
   │   │   ├── index.ts       # Re-exports only
   │   │   └── {domain}.ts    # < 300 lines
   │   └── mutations/
   │       ├── index.ts       # Re-exports only
   │       └── {action}.ts    # < 300 lines
   ├── components/
   │   ├── index.ts           # Export ALL components
   │   └── {component}.tsx    # < 200 lines
   └── index.tsx              # < 50 lines
   ```

2. **Always Include:**
   - Server directives (`'use server'` or `import 'server-only'`)
   - Auth guards (`getUser()` or `requireAnyRole()`)
   - Database patterns (read views, write schema)
   - Component index exports

3. **Never Do:**
   - Exceed file size limits
   - Write to views in mutations
   - Read from schema in queries (use views)
   - Bypass component index
   - Use dot notation in filenames
   - Skip auth guards

### Code Review Checklist

- [ ] Server directives present?
- [ ] Auth guards in place?
- [ ] File sizes within limits?
- [ ] Database patterns correct?
- [ ] Component index updated?
- [ ] Imports use index files?
- [ ] TypeScript compiles?
- [ ] Tests pass?

## CONCLUSION

The ENORAE business portal demonstrates **strong foundational compliance** at 70%, with systematic violations that can be addressed through structured refactoring.

### Key Strengths
- ✅ 100% compliance on authentication patterns (no getSession())
- ✅ 99% compliance on naming conventions
- ✅ 97% compliance on server directives
- ✅ Strong type safety throughout
- ✅ Consistent directory organization

### Critical Issues
- 🔴 9 features have duplicate API structures
- 🔴 22 mutations write to views (data integrity risk)
- 🔴 18 files missing server directives (production risk)
- 🔴 32 components exceed size limits (maintainability)

### Path Forward
With a focused 5-week effort, the business portal can achieve **100% standards compliance**. The violations are systematic and well-documented, making them straightforward to fix with the patterns established in this audit.

**Recommended Start Date:** Immediate
**Estimated Completion:** 5 weeks
**Team Size Required:** 2-3 developers
**Risk of Refactoring:** Low (structural changes, not functional)
