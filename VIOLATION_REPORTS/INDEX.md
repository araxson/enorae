## Detection Commands

Run these to verify violations or track progress:

```bash
# Count remaining violations
find /Users/afshin/Desktop/Enorae/features -type d -path '*/api/internal' | wc -l
find /Users/afshin/Desktop/Enorae/features -type d -path '*/api/queries' | wc -l
find /Users/afshin/Desktop/Enorae/features -type d -path '*/api/mutations' | wc -l

# List specific violations

         admin/staff, business/appointments
Batch 2: business/chains, business/inventory, business/inventory-usage,
         business/notifications, business/reviews
Batch 3: business/settings-roles, business/staff, business/staff-schedules,
         business/staff-services, customer/discovery

## Expected Outcomes

After completing all phases:

✓ All 51 affected features will follow standard structure:
```
features/{portal}/{feature}/
├── api/
│   ├── queries.ts
│   └── mutations.ts
├── components/
│   └── *.tsx
├── types.ts
├── schema.ts
└── index.tsx
```

✓ No `api/internal/` directories remain
✓ No `api/queries/` or `api/mutations/` folders remain
✓ All features have required `types.ts` and `schema.ts`
✓ `npm run typecheck` passes
✓ No broken imports
