## 3. Critical Issues Found

**File:** `app/(business)/business/metrics/operational/page.tsx:1`
```typescript
// ❌ BROKEN IMPORT
import { OperationalMetrics } from '@/features/business/metrics/operational'
```

**Problem:** Module `/features/business/metrics/operational` doesn't exist
**Impact:** Page crashes, TypeScript error
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL

### 3.2 CRITICAL: Missing Type Exports (56 errors total)

**File:** `lib/types/app.types.ts`

Missing exports causing cascading errors:
1. `AppointmentWithDetails` - Used in 8+ files
2. `SalonView` - Used in business features
3. `CustomerFavoriteView` - Used in customer features
4. `StaffView` - Used in staff features

**Affected Files:**
- `features/business/dashboard/api/types.ts`
- `features/business/dashboard/components/recent-bookings.tsx`
- `features/customer/dashboard/api/appointments.queries.ts`
- `features/customer/dashboard/api/favorites.queries.ts`
- `features/customer/dashboard/components/upcoming-bookings.tsx`
- `features/staff/dashboard/api/queries.ts`
- `features/staff/dashboard/components/*.tsx`

**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL

### 3.3 HIGH: Type Safety Issues

- `features/customer/appointments/components/appointment-detail.tsx` - Status property access
- `features/customer/dashboard/components/customer-metrics.tsx` - Progress/showHearts props

**Priority:** 🟠 HIGH

### 3.4 MEDIUM: Authorization & Multi-Salon

**Good Practices Found:**
- ✅ All DAL functions use `requireAnyRole(ROLE_GROUPS.BUSINESS_USERS)`
- ✅ `getUserSalon()` properly checks auth
- ✅ Multi-salon support via `getUserSalonIds()`
- ✅ Tenant owner gets chain overview

**Issues:**
- ⚠️ Some functions use deprecated `getUserSalonId(userId)` instead of `requireUserSalonId()`
- ⚠️ Inconsistent salon filtering in multi-location features

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

## 5. Architecture Issues

### 5.1 Type System

**Problems:**
1. Missing type re-exports in `lib/types/app.types.ts`
2. Types defined locally instead of using central exports
3. `any` types in some test files

**Solution:** Add missing exports and consolidate type definitions

### 5.2 Data Access Layer

**Good Practices:**
- ✅ `import 'server-only'` in queries
- ✅ `'use server'` in mutations
- ✅ Auth checks in every function
- ✅ Query public views, mutate schema tables

**Issues:**
- ⚠️ Some functions missing comprehensive error handling
- ⚠️ Deprecated helper functions still in use

### 5.3 Components

**Good Practices:**
- ✅ Using shadcn/ui components
- ✅ Proper Server/Client component split
- ✅ Layout components used (Stack, Grid, Section)

**Issues:**
- ⚠️ No reusable business-specific components directory
- ⚠️ Revenue charts not implemented
- ⚠️ Metrics visualization limited
