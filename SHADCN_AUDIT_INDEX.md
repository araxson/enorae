## Key Principles from the Audit

### Rule 1: Component Slots are Pre-Styled
Badge, CardTitle, CardDescription, etc. already have styling. Don't add className.

### Rule 2: Layout Classes Only on Components
Flex, gap, padding, margins are OK. Colors, fonts, borders go on children.

### Rule 3: Use Card for Bordered Containers
Replace all `<div className="rounded-lg border">` with `<Card>`.

### Rule 4: Use Card Slots for Content Structure
CardTitle, CardDescription, CardHeader, CardContent, CardFooter handle layout.
