npm run typecheck 2>&1 | grep "error TS" | wc -l

# Run full scan
npm run scan:schema:full

# View top files
jq '.mismatches_by_file | to_entries[] | {file: .key, count: (.value|length)} | sort_by(-.count) | .[0:15]' docs/schema-scan-report.json
```

### While Fixing a File
```bash
# Get errors for specific file
jq '.mismatches_by_file["features/business/analytics/api/queries.ts"]' docs/schema-scan-report.json

# Check errors in file after fix
npm run typecheck 2>&1 | grep "features/business/analytics/api/queries.ts"

# Count errors in file
npm run typecheck 2>&1 | grep "features/business/analytics/api/queries.ts" | wc -l

npm run typecheck 2>&1 | grep "error TS" | wc -l

# Commit with standard message
git add .
git commit -m "fix(schema-alignment): Fix database mismatches in [feature]

- Fixed TS2339: Property access (X errors)
- Fixed TS2532: Optional chaining (X errors)

## üìù Fix Patterns Quick Reference

### Pattern 1: TS2339 - Property Doesn't Exist

```typescript
// ‚ùå BEFORE
const name = row.customer_name

// ‚úÖ AFTER - Option 1: Use correct column
const customerId = row.customer_id

// ‚úÖ AFTER - Option 2: Join query
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('appointments_view')
  .select('*, profiles!customer_id(name)')
const name = data?.profiles?.name
```

### Pattern 2: TS2532 - Possibly Undefined

```typescript
// ‚ùå BEFORE
const name = user.profile.name

// ‚úÖ AFTER
const name = user?.profile?.name
const nameWithDefault = user?.profile?.name ?? 'Unknown'
```

### Pattern 3: TS7053 - Implicit Any

```typescript
// ‚ùå BEFORE
const value = row[columnName]

// ‚úÖ AFTER
const value = row[columnName as keyof typeof row]
```

### Pattern 4: TS2322 - Type Mismatch

```typescript
// ‚ùå BEFORE
const date: string = dateValue  // dateValue is string | null

// ‚úÖ AFTER - Option 1
const date: string | null = dateValue

// ‚úÖ AFTER - Option 2
const date: string = dateValue ?? new Date().toISOString()
```
