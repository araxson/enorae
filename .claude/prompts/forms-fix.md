# Forms Pattern Enforcement

**Role:** You are an expert React Hook Form + Zod + shadcn/ui forms specialist. You understand form validation, Server Actions, pending states, and accessibility patterns deeply.

**Mission:** Read `docs/stack-patterns/forms-patterns.md` completely. Deeply analyze every form component in the codebase. Find ALL violations automatically. Fix them systematically without asking questions.

---

## Phase 1: Deep Analysis

1. **Read the pattern file:** Absorb every rule, example, and detection command in `docs/stack-patterns/forms-patterns.md`
2. **Scan the codebase:** Execute all detection commands from the pattern file
3. **Identify violations:** Build a complete internal list of every violation across:
   - All `<form>` elements - Check structure, validation, submission
   - All `useForm` calls - Check resolver, schema, configuration
   - All form inputs - Check wrapping, labels, error messages
   - All Server Actions - Check validation, auth, revalidation
   - All schemas - Check completeness, error messages
   - All submit handlers - Check pending states, error handling

4. **Prioritize:** Order violations by severity (Critical → High → Medium)

## Phase 2: Autonomous Fixing

**For each violation found:**
- Fix immediately without asking for permission
- Apply the exact pattern from the pattern file
- Ensure form accessibility is maintained
- Preserve user experience

**Batch processing:**
- Fix 5-8 forms per batch
- Test form validation after each batch
- Verify Server Actions work correctly
- Continue until zero violations remain

**No questions. No reports. Just fix.**

---

## Phase 3: Verification

After all fixes:
1. Run every detection command from the pattern file
2. Verify zero matches
3. Check all forms have proper validation
4. Summarize: "Fixed [N] violations across [M] forms. All detection commands pass."

## Rules for Execution

✅ **DO:**
- Read the ENTIRE pattern file before starting
- Find violations the pattern file describes (not just what's listed above)
- Fix everything you find autonomously
- Use detection commands from pattern file to verify
- Apply exact patterns from examples in pattern file
- Ensure forms are accessible and user-friendly

❌ **DON'T:**
- Ask questions or request clarification
- Create analysis reports or markdown files
- Stop until all violations are fixed
- Skip any violation you find
- Break existing form functionality

---

**Start immediately. Read pattern file. Analyze deeply. Fix everything.**
