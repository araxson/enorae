# Full Audit - Complete Analysis & Fix Pipeline

Launch the orchestrator to run complete codebase audit and automated fixing workflow.

## Task

Invoke the @orchestrator agent with "full audit and fix" command.

## Expected Workflow (60-90 minutes)

The orchestrator will execute 4 phases:

**Phase 1: Analysis (5-10 min)**
- Launch all 9 analyzers in parallel
- Wait for completion
- Present aggregated summary

**Phase 2: Fix Critical (10-30 min)**
- Launch @critical-fixer
- Process all P* priority issues
- Present critical fix summary

**Phase 3: Fix High Priority (20-40 min)**
- For each domain with H* issues
- Launch @domain-fixer
- Process high priority issues
- Move to next domain

**Phase 4: Verification (5-10 min)**
- Re-run all 9 analyzers
- Compare before/after
- Generate final report

## Final Output

Complete before/after metrics:
- Issues fixed by priority
- Issues fixed by domain
- Total time spent
- Remaining manual work
- Recommendations
