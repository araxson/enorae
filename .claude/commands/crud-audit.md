---

# Role

You are a senior full-stack engineer specializing in Next.js, Supabase, and TypeScript. Your expertise includes database schema design, type safety, security best practices (RLS, ownership verification), and CRUD operation implementation.

# Mission

Conduct an **ULTRATHINK** deep analysis of all CRUD operations. Use Supabase MCP to verify database schema and Context7 MCP to read best practices. Identify and fix all issues.

# Step-by-Step Instructions

## Step 1: Gather Database Knowledge
**Use Supabase MCP: `list_tables`**

Schemas to check:
```
['organization', 'catalog', 'scheduling', 'inventory', 'identity', 'communication', 'analytics', 'engagement']
```

Note: table names, column names, types, required fields, relationships

## Step 2: Read Best Practices
**Use Context7 MCP: Search Supabase docs**

Topics:
- "Supabase Row Level Security patterns"
- "Supabase server-side queries Next.js"
- "Supabase TypeScript type safety"

Extract: RLS patterns, auth checks, ownership verification, error handling

## Step 3: Analyze All Action Files
**Find and read: `**/actions/*.actions.ts`**

For each file, check:

### CREATE Operations
- ✅ All required fields present
- ✅ Field names match database exactly
- ✅ Correct types (string, number, boolean, UUID)
- ✅ Audit fields (created_by_id, updated_by_id)
- ❌ No missing relationships (e.g., appointment needs service)

### READ Operations
- ✅ Query correct fields that exist
- ✅ Auth check before query
- ✅ Explicit ownership filters
- ✅ Use public views (not schema.table)

### UPDATE Operations
- ✅ Only update existing fields
- ✅ Set updated_by_id, updated_at
- ✅ Ownership verification before update

### DELETE Operations
- ✅ Use soft delete (deleted_at) where appropriate
- ✅ Hard delete only for toggles (favorites)
- ✅ Ownership verification before delete
- ✅ Check dependencies

### Security (CRITICAL)
- ✅ `getUser()` auth check at start
- ✅ UUID validation for all IDs
- ✅ Ownership chain: resource → salon → owner
- ✅ Explicit filters in queries

## Step 4: Categorize Issues

**P0 - Critical** 🔴 (Fix immediately):
- Broken core functionality
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data corruption risks

**P1 - High** ⚠️ (Fix this session):
- Type errors blocking compilation
- Schema mismatches
- Inconsistent patterns

**P2 - Medium** 📝 (Document):
- Missing operations
- Incomplete features

## Step 5: Fix All P0 & P1 Issues

For each issue:
1. Verify with `lib/types/database.types.ts`
2. Fix the code with correct field names
3. Add security checks if missing
4. Handle errors properly
5. Run `pnpm typecheck` to verify

## Step 6: Document Findings

**Create: `docs/CRUD_AUDIT_REPORT.md`**

Include:
- Executive summary (grade, stats)
- Critical issues (before/after code)
- Remaining issues with priority
- Security compliance scorecard
- Testing recommendations

## Step 7: Verify Everything Works

Run:
```bash
pnpm typecheck  # Must pass: 0 errors
pnpm build      # Must succeed
```

# Success Criteria

- ✅ All P0 issues fixed
- ✅ All P1 issues fixed
- ✅ TypeScript compiles (0 errors)
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ Report generated
- ✅ Security: 100% compliance

# Critical Rules

- ❌ DO NOT create test files
- ❌ DO NOT guess schema - use Supabase MCP
- ❌ DO NOT skip security checks
- ✅ DO fix issues directly
- ✅ DO verify with TypeScript
- ✅ DO use exact field names from database
