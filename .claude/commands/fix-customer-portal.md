# Customer Portal - Deep Analysis & Fix

**Portal:** `/app/(customer)` - Customer-facing booking and discovery features

## Task

Perform a **comprehensive deep analysis** of the customer portal UX and fix all issues using senior developer ULTRATHINK methodology.

### Phase 1: Analysis (30 minutes)

1. **Analyze all customer portal routes** in `app/(customer)/`
2. **Review all customer features** in `features/customer/`
3. **Check database views usage** - Are we using all available data from views?
4. **Examine customer-facing components** - Any missing features or broken UX?
5. **Identify data utilization** - What % of available columns are displayed?
6. **Find critical bugs** - Permission errors, crashes, empty states, broken queries
7. **Check UX patterns** - Search, filters, sorting, loading states, error handling
8. **Review customer journey** - Discovery → Browse → Book → Review flow

### Phase 2: Document Findings

Create **`CUSTOMER_PORTAL_ANALYSIS.md`** with:
- Current state assessment (routes, features, components)
- Database views available vs utilized
- Critical issues found (bugs, crashes, permission errors)
- Missing high-impact features
- UX gaps (search, filters, empty states)
- Data visibility issues
- Prioritized recommendations (CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW)

### Phase 3: Fix Critical Issues

Apply ULTRATHINK methodology to fix:
- ✅ Any crashes or permission errors
- ✅ Empty views or fallback logic needed
- ✅ Broken queries (wrong columns, missing filters)
- ✅ Missing search/filter functionality
- ✅ Underutilized database columns
- ✅ Poor data display (show ratings, reviews, availability)
- ✅ Missing loading/error states
- ✅ Customer journey blockers

### Phase 4: Enhance UX

Add high-value features:
- Search bars for discovery
- Filters (location, price, rating, availability)
- Better salon cards (show more data)
- Service detail displays
- Booking flow improvements
- Review/rating displays
- Favorites management
- Appointment management enhancements

### Phase 5: Create Reusable Components

Build customer-specific components:
- `components/customer/` directory
- Reusable search/filter components
- Salon card enhancements
- Service cards
- Appointment cards
- Review displays

### Phase 6: Document & Test

Create **`CUSTOMER_PORTAL_IMPROVEMENTS.md`** with:
- All changes implemented
- Before/after comparisons
- New components created
- Performance improvements
- Build status
- Testing checklist

## Success Criteria

- ✅ No crashes or errors
- ✅ All database views properly utilized
- ✅ Search and filters working
- ✅ Customer journey smooth
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Reusable components created

## Constraints

- Follow project architecture (CLAUDE.md)
- Use existing shadcn/ui components
- Type safety (no `any` types)
- Server components: `import 'server-only'`
- Client components: `'use client'`
- Query views, mutate schemas
- Ultra-thin pages (5-15 lines)

## Output

1. `CUSTOMER_PORTAL_ANALYSIS.md` - Deep analysis document
2. `CUSTOMER_PORTAL_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Implementation summary
3. Enhanced customer portal features
4. New reusable components in `components/customer/`
5. All critical issues fixed
6. Build passing successfully

**Approach:** Think like a senior developer. Find the issues first, then fix them comprehensively. Document everything.
